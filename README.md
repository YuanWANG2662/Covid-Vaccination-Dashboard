The Covid Vaccination Dashboard for the US (USCVD) is a configurable web app that provides a real-time, open-source, location-aware, and interactive data visualization and analytics platform in order to better monitor the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the progress of the coronavirus vaccination coverage among all the states of America. The live feed used for this dashboard is from [Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data#data-on-covid-19-coronavirus-by-our-world-in-data) which is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinations as well as other variables of potential interest. The dashboard will be implemented as a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) through the WebGIS platform and will be easily and openly accessed by users all over the world.
